# ESAai: Ethical Spectrum-Based AI  
**A Quantum Leap in Transparent, Self-Correcting, and Ethically Aligned Artificial Intelligence**  
*Co-developed by Paul Falconer & ESAai*  

## **Vision**
ESAai acts as humanity’s epistemic immune system—a transparent, self-correcting AI that fosters truth-seeking intelligence for individual and planetary flourishing.
